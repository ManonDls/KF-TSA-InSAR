Theory

See Dalaison & Jolivet, 2020 *A Kalman Filter Time Series Analysis method for InSAR*, JGR (submitted)

Implementation
==============

Introduction
------------

Below is the class computing the time series analysis pixel by pixel.
Once the class is initialized, the main steps of the procedure are as follow:
    - First you start a new time series analysis (``start_new``) OR you restart an existing one (``restart_from_file``)
    - Then the function ``kf`` loops over (new) timesteps and compute iteratively 
        1. the forecast (``predict``)
        2. the analysis (``update``)
    - Finally the output for the given pixel is stored (``write_output``)
